1) Selection sort : 

1) Consider an entire array first. 
2) Find the minimum element and put it at first position.
3) Now, as minimum element is placed at it's actual position, ignore it.
4) Start with 2nd element as if 2nd element is the first element of remaining array.
5) Find the minimum element from this remaining array and place it at 2nd position.
6) Repeat this process until the end of array.

2) Bubble sort : 

1) Start with comparing the adjecent elements.
2) Swap the elements by comparing.
3) Repeat the iteration unless there is no swap happen in inner for loop.
4) If there happens no swap in inner loop, it means that array is sorted now.
5) Maintain a flag to check if there happened at least one swap in inner loop.

3) Merge Sort :
