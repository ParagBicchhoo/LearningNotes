# Apache nifi is the data logostic platform that is used for automating the movement of data between disparate systems.
It has different processors file getFile and putFile and we can configure it to copy file from source to destination.
==================================================================================================================================
# What is a processor : Atomic element in Nifi which can do some simple task.
Nifi have a processor for almost anything.
Nifi supports custom processors as well.
A processor can : 
1) Add, update or remove attributes of a flowfile.
2) Change contents of a flowfile.

Different processors available in Nifi : 
1) Data ingestion processors : These are the processors used to ingest data.
examples : GenerateFlowFile, GetJMSTopic, GetKafka, GetFile, GetHttp, Querydatabasetable, GetFtp, ListenFtp, ListenHTTP.

2) Data transformation processors : Transform data to various formats accoring to requirement.
Examples : ConvertRecord, Replacetext, EncryptContent, UpdateRecord, CompressContent, TransformXML, ConvertJSONToSQL,
ConvertCharacterSet, JoltTransformJSON.

3) Data Egress or Sending Data Processors : Send processed data to various destinations. 
Examples : PutEmail, PutSFTP, PutKafka, PutFile, PutJMS, PutMongDB, PutFTP, PutSQL, PutHDFS.

4) Routing and mediation processors : Conditionally change the way how a flowfile is processed.
Examples : ControlRate, RouteOnAttribute, ScanContent, DetectDuplicate, RounteOnContent, ValidateXML, DistributeLoad, 
ScanAttribute, ValidateCSV.

5) Database Access Processors : To access the database.
Examples : ConvertJSONToSQL, PutSql, PutHiveQL, ExecuteSQL, SelectHiveQL, ListDatabaseTables.

6) Attribute Extraction Processors : Help extract and manupulate attributes of a flowfile from its contents or other
attributes or both.
Examples : Extract text, EvaluateXPath, UpdateAttribute, LogAttribute.

7) System interaction processors : Support to execute OS specific commands specified by the user and writes
the output of that command to a flowfile.
Examples : ExecuteProcess, ExecuteStreamCommand

8) Splitting and aggregation processors : Help to split or agrregate data based on our requirement.
Examples : SplitText, SplitRecord, SegmentContent, SplitJSON,
SegmentContent, MergeContent, SplitXML, UnpackContent, QueryRecord.

9) HTTP and UDP processors : Ingest or send data using HTTP and UDP protocols.
Examples : GetHTTP, PostHTTP, Listen UDP, ListenHTTP, HandleHTTPRequest, PutUDP

10) Amazon Web Service Processors : 
Examples : fetchS3Object, GetSQS, GetDynamoDB, PutS3Object, PutSQS, PutDynamoDb, PutSNS, DeleteSQS, PutLambda.

==================================================================================================================================
# FlowFile : Actual data in Nifi propogates in the form of flowfile. Actual data -> CSV, JSON, XML, Plaintext, SQL, Binary etc.
A processor can generate a new flowfile by processing an existing flow file or ingesting new data from source.
Flowfile is composed of two components : 
1) Content : Actual data itself.
2) Attributes : key value pairs contains metatdata of the flowfile.

Flowfiles are persisted in disk.
Flowfiles are passed by reference.
A new flowfile will be created if the content of the existing flowfile is modified or new data is ingested 
from the source.
New flowfile is not created if the attributes of the existing flowfile is modified.
==================================================================================================================================
# What is a connection.

In Nifi all the processors can be connected with each other to create a data processing flow.

Processors are linked via connections.
Each connection will act as a queue for a FlowFiles.
==================================================================================================================================
# What is a process group ?

In Nifi a set of processors can be connected to form a process group
Process groups helps to maintain large and complex data flow.
Input and output ports are used to move data between process groups.
==================================================================================================================================
# What is controller service ? 

Controler service is a shared srevice that can be used by a processor.
Controller service can hold a DB connection details.
We can create a controller service for a CSV reader, JSON writer and many more.
==================================================================================================================================

Processor Configurations, Connections and Relationships in NIFI : 

Each processor in NIFI has a standard set of configurations and unique set of configurations.

Common Configurations : 
1) Name : Define a meaningful name for a processor.
2) Scheduling : Used to schedule a processor to run at a particular interval using these configurations.
If run scheduling is 0 seonds then it runs continuously.
