What is OAuth2 :

Oauth which stands for Open authorization is a standard designed to allow a website or a application to access resources 
hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.

Examples : 1) When you login using facebook to a third party application, facebook grant access to users information to third 
party websites without sharing the users password and other private sensitive data.


Best practices for microservices security : 

1) Carry the login information everywhere via a stateless protocol like OAuth. Every service talking to other services carry
oAuth token with them. And it get propogated throughout the system.

2) Traffic between microservice consumer and endpoint need to be encrypted. But there found a lot of security vulnerabilities 
with SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0.
Recommendation use TLS 1.2

OAuth2 for securing microservices : 

OAuth is meant for authorization and not authentication.
It was originally created for a service to authorize a service.
Your service wants to authorize with google drive to read certain photos.
You cannot ask the user for his credentials.
This is where OAuth comes in.

OAuth2 flow : 

1) Authorization code flow : 

User has logged in to photo printing server but my photo is on google drive. fetch my photos from google drive.
Printing server go to Google drive and says my user wants to access resource from your drive.
Authorization server(of google drive) goes to user (resource owner) and say this client(printing service wensite) wants to access you files.
Are you okay with that? If yes, you as a resource owner enter your your google username and password and authorization server sends a code to photo printing
service to access the token.
Client uses this codeto get token which is access token.
This access token can be used to get the resources.

Implementation for social authentication: 

Social authentication cannot be leveraged for enterprise level application.

If your application wants to access the resources of Github then you need to register your application with github.
While registering callback url is the URL where application should be redirected after successful authentication.

Create a bean of security filter chain
http.authorizeRequest().anyRequest().authenticated().and().oauth2Login();

Create an object of ClientRegistrationRepository:
CommonOauth2Provider.GITHUB.getbuilder("github").clientId().clientSecret().build();
CommonOauth2Provider contains some common provider such as GITHUB, GOOGLE< FACEBOOK, OCTA and their details.

Create a controller that takes OAuth2AuthenticationToken Object as an input which will contain all information related to user.
Once to hit this controller, you will be automatically redirected to github login page. Once you login you will be shown one window
where it will ask your permission if you want to athorize to access the resources.

2) Flow in microservices : 

Client credentials flow is generally used here.

Client -> is a website or a service [Client is my website]
Client makes a request to resource owner[me] whether I can access this resource.
Resource owner[me] talks to authorization server[google auth server] and auth server grant the client a token for access.
Client gives token to resource server[google drive]
Resource server checks the validity of token with auth server.
If valid resource server gives access.

=====================================================================================================================================================

Implementation : 

Go to OAuth2 playground website and register a client.
Click on register a client.
You will receive client_id and client_secret

Password flow : Client take your username and password and send that to authorization server.
In that case user won't see authorization server login dialog. in this case you will see printing website page to enter your username and password.

=====================================================================================================================================================

Client credentials flow : This flow is best when there is machine to machine communication

1) Client which is a website itself send client_id and client_secret to the authorization server.
2) Authorization server send back a bearer toekn which is again used by client to access the resource from resource server.
3) Resource server validate this token from authorization server and return the response to client in case the token is valid.

=====================================================================================================================================================

Implementation : 

1) include dependency spring-security-oauth2 in pom.xml
2) Create one spring boot application called as authorization server (@EnableAuthorizationServer)
3) Create one spring boot application called as resource server (@EnableResourceServer)
