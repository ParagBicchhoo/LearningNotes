Add docker file plugin to pom.xml file. (Docker file maven plugin)
Inside goals of plugin also add build and push goal so that it will build the docker file to create a 
docker image and push the image to our docker registry.
Create a Dockerfile parallel to pom.xml only.

Docker file configurations : 

FROM openjdk:11                                              -> What java version you are using
ARG JAR_FILE = target/*.jar                                  -> local path of jar file
COPY ${JAR_FILE} user-service.jar                            -> where to copy that jar file
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/user-service.jar"]             -> What command to execute to run the jar file  
EXPOSE 9002                                                  -> Port to keep reserved for this application

Now we need to build this.
Execute command : "mvn clean package Dockerfile:push" to build the docker file and push it to docker hub.

Do above process for all the microservices.
