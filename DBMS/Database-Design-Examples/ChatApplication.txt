group_id (FK)

Message can be sent to either group or to a contact. so message table will
have two different FKs for contact_id and group_id
Instead what we can do is replace the message_group table with conversation 
so that the conversation can be a group as well as a contact person. 

1) message [Will contain only information related to message and to which conversation this message belong to]
Conversation can simply be a conversation with a contact or a conversation within a group.

message_id  (PK)
from_number
to_number
message_text
sent_datetime
conversation_id (FK)

2) contact

contact_id (PK)
first_name
last_name
profile_photo
phone_number

3) conversation [Conversation can be a simple conversation with one person or group conversation]

conversation_id (PK)
conversation_name

4) group_member [This table will ontain members within all group hence contact_id is associated with conversation_id]

contact_id (FK) 
conversation_id (FK) []
joined_datetime
left_datetime
