Problems with sysout

It prints only logs on console and not in file
println method is synchronized and slows down the perfromance

Log4j is reliable, fast.

LogManager.getLogger() gives you a logger according to behaviour configured in log4j2.properties/log4j2.xml

behaviours in properties file : 

Order : All trace debug info warn error fatal of

Behaviours include layout indicating how to format the message
filter tell upto which level to print the logs,. If you say debug all after debug will be printed like info warn error fatal of.

destination -> console or file

Object render -> how to print text or xml

appenders = console
appenders.console.layout.type = PatternLayout

Spring boot user commons logging internally for logging.

Log4j offer better way of configurability and features like passing logs to file and even database.

MDC stands for mapped diagnostic context which help to provide contextual information to your logger/
Example you want to print user id everywhere in logs
Just put that inside MDC which is a key value based data structure.

Thread context map is the equivalent of context.

ThreadContextMap has bot stack and map.
