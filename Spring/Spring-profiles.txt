Spring profiles helps seggregating your application configurations and make them available to specific 
environments only.

We have different environments in our application like dev, QA, production.
Now configuration files are environment specific.
You can also use @Profile on beans.
Example : OracleDataSource or MysqlDataSource.

Create separate config file application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties files for each environment.
Only include environment specific properties to that file.

Finally create one parent application.properties file like : 

spring.application.name = Spring profiles
spring.profiles.active = test
