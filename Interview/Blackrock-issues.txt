1) VDI issues slowness. Connect with helpdesk, and they execute some policies on system. For some days VDI will run good and become slow again.
2) Random pipeline failures and no devops engineer to handle these issues.
3) running pipeline everytime to check the code coverage and sonar issues. no permissions for adding plugins in IDE.(Running one pipeline takes any
where between 10-20 minutes).
4) Add test cases for previously writen entire class as it was not covered before sonar came into picture even if I make a small change.
5) No good behaviour from team lead. getting frustrated over small things.
6) 3 developments going on in parallel. Merge the code to create conflicts and break the code.
7) My development wold required many times to merge the code manually which would again create conflicts merging back to source branch
8) Hard dependencies between different modules. If someone make changes in his code it would affect my code, eg. persistence layer.
9) No centaralized configuration management. Lots of configurations in lots of files to make it difficult to manage and tacle config issues.
10) No testing team to verify developer's work. Developer himself responsible for doing end to end testing which he does not hold expertiese in.
11) Publishing the pipeline in artiactory is another overhead. Publish pipeline has more steps and fails many time and we have to keep retryng.
Until it takes 1.5-2 hour to successfully run the entire pipeline. And there are three servers to publish the jars for.
