Atomic : These are thread safe versions of variables.

Volatile : For normal variables, For each thread a copy of original variable is created and changes are performed in that variable.
Hence a higher chances of data inconsistency.
When we declare a variable as volatile each thread perform operation on the main memory and not cached memory.

Synchronized : A method or a block can be synchronized, this keyword make sure that, only one thread can access the method 
or a block on a given object.

Transient variable are used in serialization context. If we donot want any variable to be used while serialization 
and deserialization then transient variables are used.
