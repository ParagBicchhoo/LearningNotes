Basics Learning : 

Java 8 new features : 

1) Lambda expressions : Are introduced to bring functional programming capabilities to java. To reduce the overall size of a java program.
2) Method references : Referencing methods of functional interfaces by their names instead of invoking them directly. Using functions as parameters.
3) Default methods : interfaces will have default methods impelementation.
4) New tools − New compiler tools and utilities are added like ‘jdeps’ to figure out dependencies
5) Stream API : New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing
6) Date time API : Improved date time API
7) Optional : Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly
8) Nashorn, JavaScript Engine − A Java-based engine to execute JavaScript code.

Lambda expressions important characteristics : 

1) Optional type declarartion :  Compiler automatically interpret the type of parameters passed
2) Optional paranthesis for variables of methods : If method has less than 2 parameters then paranthesis are optional.
3) Optional curly braces : If method body has only one statement then curly braces are optional.
4) Optional return statemnt :  If method body has only one statement then return statement is not compulsory.

Method references : 

Method references help to point to methods of functional interfaces by their names. Method references are described using symbol  "::".
Method refernce can be used to point to following types of methods : 
a) Static methods
b) Instance methods
c) Constructors using new operator (TreeSet :: new) 

Functional interfaces defined in java.util.Function package : 
1) Predicate
It is a functional interface with method test to return a boolean value. This interface is used to test a particular condition.

Default methods : 

Default methods are added in java 8 because some of the interfaces in Collection API does not have forEach method impelentation in it like List.
And adding that method will break the current implementation of Collection API.
So that List , Collection interfaces will have this method as a default method and classes impelemting these interfaces will not have to implement it.

With default functions in interfaces there is a possibility that class impelementing two interfaces with same default methods there will be an ambiguity.
This is how it can be resolved : 
1) Write your own implementation of that method in class.
2) call the methods using super keyword. : InterfaceName.super.methodName

Streams : 

With streams you can process data in declarative way just like SQl statements
Streams are sequence of objects from source which supports aggregate functions just like sql.

Characteristics of stream : 

1) Provide set of elements in sequential manner. It never stores the elements.
2) Streams takes Collection, Arrays as a input.
3) Streams supports aggregate operations like filter map limit reduce and so on.
4) Pipelining : Most of the stream operations return stream itself so that the results can be pipelined. 
Collect is the terminal operation which is performed at the end of the process
to mark the end of the stream.

Collection interface has two ways to generate streams : 
1) stream() : Returns a sequential stream considering collection as it's source
2) parallelStream() : Returns a parallel stream.

Agreagate functions : 

1) forEach : to iterate over streams
2) map : map an element to it's results
3) filter : eliminte an element based on criteria
4) limit : limit number of elements
5) sorted : to sort the elements
6) Collectors
7) statistics collectors are introduced to calculate all statistics when stream processing is being done.

Optional class : 

Optional container is used to hold not null objects.
public final class Optional<T> extends Object

Self doubts : 

1) Why default methods
2) why static methods
3) Why method references
4) Difference between stream and parallel streams.

1) 
In a typical design based on abstractions, where an interface has one or multiple implementations, 
if one or more methods are added to the interface, all the implementations will be forced to implement them too. Otherwise, 
the design will just break down.

In this way, backward compatibility is neatly preserved without having to refactor the implementers.

2) 
Java interface static method helps us in providing security by not allowing implementation classes to override them.

3)
Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. 
It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. 
Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.

4) 
Parallel streams divide the provided task into many and run them in different threads, utilizing multiple cores of the computer. 
On the other hand sequential streams work just like for-loop using a single core. ... 
Parallel execution of streams run multiple iterations simultaneously in different available cores.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main objective of lambda expression : To bring functional programming benifits to java.
What is lambda expression : It is an anonymous function(nameless function)

Functional Interface : An interface with only one abstract method are called functional 
intefaces.(SAM - Single abstract method)

Example : 

Runnable
Comparable
Callable
ActionListener

If you want to invoke lambda expression : FI must be required.

return keyword loophole : Without curly braces we cannot use return keyword.
Within curly braces If we want to return value  , we must use return statement.

Now to call lambda expressions we must go for Functional interfaces which contains single abstract methods.

Note : Fuctional interface can contain any number of default method and any number of static methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can use @functionalInterface annotation to declare an interface as a functional interface.

Case 1: @functionalInterface
Interface A{
public void m1();
}
 @functionalInterface
Interface B extends A{
}

Valid case

Case 2 : 
@functionalInterface
Interface A{
public void m1();
}
 @functionalInterface
Interface B extends A{
public void m1();
}
valid case as m1 is overriden

Case 3 : 

@functionalInterface
Interface A{
public void m1();
}
 @functionalInterface
Interface B extends A{
public void m2();
}
Invalid case


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****Imp : We can assign a lambda expression to functional interface only.

e.g.

Interface Interf {
public void m1(int a);
}

class Test{
public static void main(String[] args){

Interf i = (a) -> syso("Hello");
i.m1();
}
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How compiler can guess the type of arguments in lambda expressions.

Ans : Arguments we define in lambda expression are nothing but the arguments of single 
abstract method defined inside the fuctional interface assocaited with it.
Hence compiler can guess the arguments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anonymous inner class case : 
case1:
Thread t = new Thread(){

};
case2:
Runnable r = new Runnable(){

};

Now this anonymous class extends Thread class and implement Runnable interface 
respectively in case 1 and 2.

If an anonymous inner class is a functional interface then only you can replace 
that anonymous inner class with lambda expression.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why default methods : 

So that every implementation class should not have to implement it.
How to call default methods : Call it using implementation class object.
You can override default method in your implementation class if you are not 
happy with its implementation provided in an interface.
During implementation default keyword cannot be used in class.
Simply implement default method like : 

public void m1(){
}

Object class methods cannot be used as default method in an interface because 
Object class methods are already available in implementation class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why static methods in an interface : 
Class is a heavy concept and if you want to define only static methods why to go for 
heavy but simply go for light thing which is an interface
As static method is nowhere related to object why go for a class
These static methods can be directly called using Interface name and this is the only way to call it.
It cannot be called using implementation class of that interface.
You can also add main method inside Interface from 1.8 version onwards

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predefined Functional Interfaces : 

Predicate - method test() - return boolean
Function  - method apply() - return some object
Consumer -  method accept() - does not return anything
Supplier - method get() - does not take input and return something. Eg. date supplier, 
Random OTP supplier

Two argument predefined functional interfaces : 

BiPredicate - two input arguments predicate
BiFunction - two input arguments Function
BiConsumer - two input arguments Consumer

Primitive functional interfaces : 

IntPredicate
IntFunction
IntConsumer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Streams : 

When we want to process objects from the collection then we should go for streams.

Method to get stream.

java.util.Stream s = c.stream();

Stream methods : 

stream() - returns a stream which can be used for processing
parallelStream() - with multithreading
filter() - take a predicate to return elements based on filter.
map() - take a function to return a separate updated list
collect() - collect elements from map or filter
count() - count elements of map or filter.
sorted() - sort elements of a stream (ascending order) - To change sorting order pass 
comparator object lambda expression inside sorted() method.
min() - need to provide comparator for sorting
max() -need to provide comparator for sorting
get() - to get  a single element
forEach() - take Function and that function will be performed
toArray() - to convert collection of objects to array.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional keyword need to understand : 

Optional harnesses the type system for doing work that you'd otherwise have to do all in your head: remembering whether or not a given reference may be null.
This is good. It's always smart to let the compiler handle boring drugework, and reserve human thought for creative, interesting work.

Without Optional, every reference in your code is like an unexploded bomb. Accessing it may do something useful, or else it may terminate your program wth an exception.

With Optional and without null, every access to a normal reference succeeds, and every reference to an Optional succeeds unless it's unset and you failed to check for that. 
That is a huge win in maintainability.

Unfortunately, most languages that now offer Optional haven't abolished null, so you can only profit from the concept by instituting a strict policy of "absolutely no null, ever".
 Therefore, Optional in e.g. Java is not as compelling as it should ideally be.
 
It also reduce the complexity as compared to null checks.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why method references were introduced in java 8 : 

Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.
