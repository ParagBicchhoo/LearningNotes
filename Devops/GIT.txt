Types of version control system : 

1) Centralized 
2) Distributed

Distributed version control system is better as even if central repository got corrupted or crashed every developer has local repository.

GIT is distributed version control system tool.
SVN is centralized version control system tool

Reason why GIT is famous : 

1) No single point of failure 
2) Performance is good
3) Without network also developer can continue his work
4) Staging area is the biggest strength of GIT which is a virtual area.

While committing changes from working directory to local repository we need to add files to staging area which exist between working directory and local repository.

Use of staging area : Crosscheck or Double check changes before commit.

Another important advantage of GIT : Branching and Merging

All branches are isolated from each other.
Hence multiple flows of developement are possible
GIT is a freewere
Provide support for multiple platforms

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) git add --> Add files from working directory to staging area
2) git commit --> Send staged changes to local repository
3) git push --> Move local repository changes to remote repository
4) git clone/git pull --> Bring files from remore repository to local repository
cloning : creating duplicate copy , used only once i.e. first time
pull : already working on a branch but want some updates.

Life Cycle Of File In GIT : 

Every file in GIT is in one of the following state : 

1) Untracked : New files created inworking directory - In WD
2) Staged : Files which are added to staging area - Staging area
3) In Repository/ Committed : Any file which is committed - Local repository
4) Modified : Any file which is already tracked by git but it is modified in working directory. - In WD

git status : To know status of files in all areas ( i.e. WD, Staging area, local repository 
ls : List out all files in working directory - linux command
git ls-files : List out all files in working directory which are tracked by git - git command

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git init : To provide an empty repository to our workspace so that version control is available to our working directory
Immidiately an empty repo is provided named .git (hidden dir)
git status on random repo  : fatal not a git repository
git status after git init : message : Nothing to commit

git log : Show all commit history

git commit -a -m 'message' : Add changes to staging and then commit , this is not applicable for newly created files but only for modified files.
git status -s : concise output


git config --> To check git configurtions like username , email etc.
