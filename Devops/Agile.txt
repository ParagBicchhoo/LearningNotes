There are some challenges associated with waterfall model like, 
time of developement is more and in this time competitor will be way ahead of you in terms of new features.
Once the requirement gathering and define is done, there is very little scope for new features as
software might be in a testing phase at that time.
Hence you cannot change a plan in waterfall model.
So to overcome these flaws agile came in to picture where you start your application from smallest part 
and design it accordingly.
So requirement changes are possible even in the middle of developement.

There are lots of implementations agile.
One of them is scrum.

There are 4 values and 12 principles you need to follow to be agile.

Scrum : 

Sprint is a time frame in product development in which you can deliver a potentially deployable 
feature for an application. Now the sprint can be 1 week or 2 week or 4 week depending on the 
project and client's requirement.

You can take some requiremnts from previous sprint which is also called as sprint backlog.
This task is done by scrum team which consist of around 7-8 people.
Then after 1-2 weeks you will give first increament. This increament is potentially shippable product.

There are some meetings that are managed by scrum master.
Scrum daily : short standup meeting used to planning.
scrum review
scrum retrospective

Besides there is a product owner other than scrum master.

Jira for Agile : 

Jira is a project management , Issue tracking and a bug tracking tool for agile software and business teams.

Create a new project in Jira.
We can see two main tabs -> 1) Backlog 2) Active sprints


Our journey in Jira start with Backlog. Our project management workflow for our software developement project.
So go to backlog.
Click on create issue.
Issue is basically an element in your project workflow.
If you come down to dropdown issue type you can select following element from it : 

1) Epic : Software development journey starts with epic : Abstract view of what we are creating.
2) Story : What is required to achive your epic. Story can also be called as a feature.
3) Task : We need to setup tasks to satisfy all stories and ultimatly the epic and the project.
4) Bug

Issues(Story, task or bug) can be added to a sprint by creating a new one. Start sprint button can be used to schedule a sprint.
Now once the sprint is started ,it can be seen under Active sprint section.
You can also create a subtask within a story.

Scrum Role : Hierarchy of employees working on software development project and how they function to achieve agile development.
