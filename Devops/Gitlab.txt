Gitlab Architecture : 

Gitlab Instance or Gitlab server is used to host your application code and pipeline configurations.
Gitlab instance has multiple Gitlab runners connected which are separate machines which actaully are the agents that
run the CI/CD jobs.
So Gitlab servers know what needs to be done and gitlab runners does that job.

So www.gitlab.com is a managed gitlab instance(SaaS) that offers multiple managed runners already out of the box.
And these are all managed by gitlab and hence you can start running your pipelines without any setup and configurations.

But for your own organization you wanna manage your own setup (www.gitlab.mycompany.com) where you will manage you own runners.

How to build your own pipeline : 

Pipeline is written in code and hosted in application git repository as a yaml format.
And the name of file should be .gitlab-ci.yml. So that gitlab can automatically detect that pipeline code and execute it without 
any extra configuration effort from our side.
