How to manage all these different components (microservices)?
Orchestrators helps us in deploying and managing the containers dynamically.
More people are using : scale up the application.
Something went down : Heal the application like restarting.

Kubernetes helps us in doing this.

On a hight level Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. On a granular level it is much more than only being a container orchestrator.

Components of Kubernetes  :  

Cluster : 

Control planes(Master node) + nodes (Worker nodes)

Nodes can be considered as virtual machine
Control plane or master node : 

Worker nodes : Are nothing but where your applications will be running.
Control plane will manage the worker nodes

Kubectl communicate with control plane.

Collection of worker nodes and control plane is called as kubernetes cluster.

Kubectl : Is the kubernetes CLI command line tool.
Kubectl will communicate with control plane and say I want to start 10 applications.
This communication can happen in two ways : 
1) Declarative way : You create a manifest file you write code in that and it happens. This is important. You will give that file to control plane via
Kubectl.
2) Imperative way : You are giving some commands to your cluster.

Microservices run on worker nodes.

Pod : is a scheduling unit in kubernetes.

Worker node is a server.
It has container runtime in it.
Container runtime has a pod
and pod has containers.

Steps : 

1) Create micropservices
2) Conatainerize it.
3) Put every container in pods
4) Deploy these pods ito controllers.(Deployemnt controller, Job controller are the types of controllers in kubernetes where deployment one is the default one)

Control Plane : 

Collection of various components that helps us to manage overall cluster.
It has following capabilities : 

Control plane has a API server amd kubectl communicates with API server.


One of the components of control plane is etcd. which is a database. With which API server will communicate
And then there is controller manager which will communicate with API server.
Another there is a scheduler.

API server has certain endpoints which are used by kubectl to give certain commands like hey take this yml file which is a pod defination and create a pod.
These files are also called as kubernetes manifest files. Often times this can get very complex but tools like monocle make files creation extremely easy.
Controllers take care of how many pods should be running and their health. Controller manager take care of controllers.
Controller managers has 4 functionalities : 
1) Desired state : need to create 5 pods
2) Current state : Something goes down. desired state was 5 pods but only 4 pods are running.
3) Differences : 
4) Make the changes : 

Scheduler will schedule the pods on worker nodes. Lets check which worker node is empty and best suited for it.

Architecture of kubernetes : 

Worker node architecture :
Components : 

1) Kube proxy : It is responsible for networking. This will povides IP address to nodes.

2) Kubelet : it is on every worker node. It will listen to API server. 

3) Container runtime :
