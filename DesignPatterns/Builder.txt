Traditional way of assigning values to object parameters is using constructor.
But there are some problems with this.
1) It becomes complex to assign variables.
2) It is mandatory to specify the parameter value otherwise it will give an error.

So we do it using setters. This is nothing but a builder design pattern(Creational design pattern).
