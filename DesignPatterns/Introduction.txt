GOF design patterns are divided into three groups : 

1) Creational design patterns : These patterns control object creation , initialization and class selection.
2) Behavioural design patterns : These patterns control communication, interaction and messaging between objects.
3) Structural design patterns : These patterns organize relationship between objects and classes.
