1) How are interceptors implemented where we can do authentication and authorization.
2) How deployment will happen on insuremo when we build a repository full of microservices lets say 200 microservices.
Will the deployment happen like deploy each microservice manually?
3) Build a microservices one by one and build all components around it and deploy it on AWS ECS.
4) Learn about docker and kubernetes. and how microservices and built in containerized app and deployed on kubernetes cluster. 
Try to deploy your microservice on kubernetes as well.
5) How to detect a deadlock in a running program?

There are tools available with JDKs itself those can be used to detect the deadlock situation.

3) Learn Liquibase.
4) Learn Spring DataJPA

5) Fail-fast vs Fail-Safe.
Fail-Fast iterators immediately throw ConcurrentModificationException if there is structural modification of the collection.
Collections return two types of iterators. Fail-fast or Fail-safe. Fail-fast iterators are retured by normal collections and fail-safe iterators
are returned by concurrent-collections.
Iterator it = hm.keyset().iterator();
In concurrent collection modifications are done on copy of collection.

6) Native and strictfp
strictfp is used for strict floating point calculations so that calculations can be independent of platform.
From java 17 onwards, all methods are strictfp by default.

Native method means the method is written in either c/c++ to improve performance and effective memory management as we 
can play with pointers in c and c++.

7) Add some more design patterns in list and practice them.

8) Oauth2.0 implementation of authorization code and client credentials in spring boot. 
Key cloak and openID connect.
