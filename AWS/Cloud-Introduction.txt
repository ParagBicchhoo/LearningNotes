AWS Introduction : 

***WHAT is AWS (Amazon web services) : AWS is a cloud infrastructure where we can host our application.
In 2006 Amazon started to offer IT services to the market in the form of Web services which is now a days 
called as cloud computing.

Cloud computing is just a term used for storing and accessing data over the internet. Now this data is not stored in a hard-disk of your local 
computer but is stored and accessed from a remote server.

***WHY AWS : 

Assume I want to host an application. Now to host it I need to purchase a server. 
if there is a database integration, I will need to purchase a database.
If I am using java I need to install JDK.
It means I need to setup a complete infrastructure to host an application. (1st disadvantage)
Lets assume my application is up and running and user is using my application,
Even if user is not accessing your application you will need to pay for that because you purchased these components. (2nd disadvantage)
So in future if huge amount of requests are coming to my server I will need to scale my application. Again this will be charged.

How can you overcome these issues using AWS ?

AWS will offer you to create one virtual machine, inside that virtual machine you add a server, you can add a database, and some more cloud components.
So if I want to scale my appliction, I have no need to purchase a server, I can simply specify how many instances of servers I want.

In AWS world this virtual machine is called as EC2 instance. EC2 stands for elastic compute cloud.

***HOW : 

1) create an aws account.
2) Create an EC@ instance, at last step it will create a key pair file with extension .pem. Save that file to acess EC@ instance from anywhere.

AWS Global infrastructure : 

AWS has regions and regions has availability zones connected to each other.
These availability zones are connected using low latancy high throughput link.
Availability zones has one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
Main motive of this infrastructure is availability and scalability and high fault tolerance.

AWS points of presence or edge locations : 

There are 205 edge locations across different cities.
Now consider a scenario if the users of an application is distributed across world and actual data center is close 
for a newyork guy than china guys. So china guy will experience a latency.
To mitigate this issue they have created edge locations so that request will be routed through these third party edge locations.
These edge locations send data through cloudfront to desired datacenter.
