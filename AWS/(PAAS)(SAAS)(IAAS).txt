SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are simply three ways to describe how you can use the cloud for your business.

IAAS : (Infrastructure as a service) : Here infra will be provided as a service by others (generally cloud providers) like Virtualization, Server, Storage, Networking.
Rest of the things are managed by you only like Application, Data, Runtime, Middleware, and OS.
Example : AWS EC2 (it is a plain container where you install a platform(like java, tomcat server) you want and deploy an application)

PAAS : (Platform as a service) : Here platform will be provided as a service by others (generally cloud providers) like Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, 
Server, Storage, Networking.
