Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS. 
It allows users to run and scale containerized applications on the AWS cloud.

Amazon ECS works by using a combination of Docker and AWS to manage and run containerized applications. 
Users can define their application using a Dockerfile, and then use Amazon ECS to build, store, and run their containerized application. 
Amazon ECS manages the underlying infrastructure, scaling containers in and out as needed to meet the demands of the application.

Some benefits of using Amazon ECS include:

Efficient resource utilization: Amazon ECS can automatically scale containers up or down based on the demands of the application, 
ensuring that resources are used efficiently.

High availability: Amazon ECS automatically distributes containers across multiple availability zones, ensuring high availability for applications.
Easy to use: Amazon ECS provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing and deploying containerized applications.

Amazon ECS is similar to other container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. However, 
it is fully managed by AWS and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it easy to use for those already familiar with the AWS ecosystem.

ECR - Elastic container registry is somewhere the docker containers are stored in AWS. It is same as docker hub.
