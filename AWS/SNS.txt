SNS stands for simple notification service.
Whatever notifications we receive in our phone are managed by service like AWS SNS only.

It is a push notification service. In pull notification srevice, server will go to queue and 
explicitly ckeck if there are any messages. i.e. in pull server is pulling the messages forcefully.
SQS is an example of pull notification service.

Here queue is going to SNS to supply the messages.
E.g. server is sending message to user that you need to recharge.
In push notification server is reaching the consumer that your bill is pending, or recharge need to be done.

Messages publish to SNS topic will be delivered to consumer immediately.

Publisher and subscriber communicate through topic.
Who are publishers -> AWS account holders can be publishers.
Who are subscribers -> AWS account holders or Only requesters with  certain endpoints.

Create a topic. Once topic is created,
Then i need to decide whom i want to send these messages to.
So I need to create subscriptions.
Select a protocol like email.
endpoint will contain email id.
Whenever you publish a message, messages will be sent to all the subscribers.
