How to integrate DynamoDB with spring boot application : 
Next we will deploy same spring boot application in aws eleastic beanstalk

Dynamo db are managed noSQL databses optimized for perfromance at scale.

These databases are unstructured. They do not have specific data model or 
is not organized in pre-defined manner.

Structure of dynamodb : 

RollNo : 01                       
Name : Bhupindar
Class : M.Tech                  ==> Item
Age : 31

-------------------------

RollNo : 30
Name : Aman
Branch : CSE                    ==> Item
Fav.color : Red

-------------------------

RollNo : 32
Hobby : BasketBall
Location : Meerut               ==> Item
Position : Sr.Trainer
Contact : +917387304317

--------------------------

Name, RollNo, Hobby, Location are called as attribute. Items are made up of attributes.
RollNo is common in all the items. Hence RollNo is primary key.
Table is the collection of all items.
An item consist of a primary or a composite key and flexible number of attributes.
When there are more than one primary key then it is composite key.
Lets say RollNo and EnrollmentNo are composite key.
Aggregate size of the item cannot be more than 400KB
For item size more than 400KB, put it in a S3 bucket and refer URL of S3 bucket in item of a table.

Read capacity unit : 

What amount of data you can read , what is your capacity to read. On that basis your bill will be calculated.
1) Eventually consistant
2) Stronly consistant

1 R.C.U = 4KB for strongly consistant
2 R.C.U = 2KB for eventually consistant

Eventually consistant is faster as compared to strongly consistant. Because eventually consistant reads only settled data
or the data that is properly committed. It does not wait for the data that is being replicated to finish and return just older records.
Hence eventually consistant are cheaper as compared to strongly consistant.
Where as strongly consistant wait for records to get replicated across many servers and then return results. Hence a little delay.Strongly consiatant
also does not garanty the data if there's been a delay in replication due to things like n/w connectivity.

Write capacity unit : 

1 W.C.U = 1 KB

Dynamo DB are more used in an application where read is more frequent operation.
Sacn search the table based on a specific field. Where as query search the table based on primary key.
For global tables, replicas will be created in different regions.Streams need to be enabled to use global tables.
