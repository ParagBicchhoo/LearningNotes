These are specially designed to deploy an application and you can use it.
Hence they are PAAS servers where you only need to take care of your application and data rest of the things 
are managed by Elastic beanstalk.

How to deploy spring boot web application on AWS server using elastic beanstalk : 

In this case you no need to create an EC2 instance, neither you need to add jar or war file to S3 bucket.
This step will be taken care by elastic beanstalk itself.

High level architecture of elastic beanstalk : 

When we will create an elastic bean stalk environment it will create an EC2 instance internally.
Inside that EC2 instance it will install or register a tomcat server.
And inside tomcat server we can deploy our web application.
This web application war file will be store in S3 bucket.
EC2 instance will load the war file and deploy in tomcat server.
There will be AWS elastic load balancer which will help us to redirect our request to particular web application.

How it works : 

Go to service elastic beanstalk 
create application
it will have many options like server like tomcat 
upload your code using upload option (war file) 
and create an application.

Application is now ready to use....
