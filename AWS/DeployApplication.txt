How to deploy your application on AWS EC2 instance: 

1) Create a jar of your spring boot application
2) Connect EC2 instance from putty
#Open Puttygen
#load the .pem file generated while creating an EC2 instance
#it will convert that file in to ssh key.
#Now save this private key as a file with any name
#You can find hostname of EC2 instance when you go to AWS console and click connect.
#Open putty
#Enter hostname
#Click hostname -> data
#Enter Autologin username which can be found again on AWS console and click connect.
#Go to ssh -> Auth -> Browse the private key that is converted using puttygen
And connect to the instance.

3) Command to install java : yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
now if you do run java -version it will show older version
Now run alternatives --config java
It will show two versions
select the number with latest one.
Now java --version will show latest java version.

# Click on jar and make this jar as public.
# Copy object URL so that it can be downloaded to EC2 instance.
