Why do we need access management?

--> To manage different rights to different users and roles.
IAM is a service in aws using which you can give permissions to different users
who are using the same aws account.

A company can have single AWS account in which different employees of
company can work.

E.g. there is a developer in a company who can only work on EC2 and
Elastic beanstalk.
There is a db administrator who need only to work on Dynamodb and RDS

So using IAM users account, they will have only access to concerned services.

====================================================================================

4 different components in IAM service :

1) Users
2) Groups
3) Roles
4) Policies

The very first time we create an AWS account is a root account.

Go to IAM service
Click on users
enter username
you can give two types of access to user
1) Programatic access (enables access key id and secret access key for AWS API, CLI and 
other development tools).
2) AWS management console access (enables password o allow access) 

Groups are combinations of users and we can assign a policy to a group.

Roles are assigned to an application. Lets say we create an EC2 instance and we host 
a web application in it. Now this web application has to interact with S3 services.
So I will attach this role to EC2 instance to interact with S3.
